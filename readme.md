# Launch Check List

This is very much an educational project in javascript heavy web apps. This is my attempt at creating a simple launch list web app. There are many check list apps out there but this is mine. I wouldn't take anything here and use in production as I'm new to js heavy apps, js templates, Backbone.js, etc. This is a personal experiment app.

I'm using Backbone.js along with localStorage to store tasks. Currently the app is very much incomplete.
